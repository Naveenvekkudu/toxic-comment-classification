### Toxic Comment Classification using LSTM

This repository contains code for a toxic comment classification model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model aims to identify and classify toxic comments in text data.

### Overview

Toxic comments are prevalent in online platforms and can lead to harmful interactions. This project utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to detect and classify toxic comments into various categories such as insults, threats, hate speech, etc.

### Data

The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of toxic comments. The dataset includes comments from various sources, annotated with labels indicating the type of toxicity present.

### Model Architecture

The LSTM model processes sequences of text data, capturing contextual information to make predictions. The architecture includes embedding layers, LSTM layers, and fully connected layers, followed by output layers for multi-label classification.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Preprocess the data as necessary and train the model using the provided scripts.
4. Evaluate the model performance and tune hyperparameters as needed.
5. Deploy the trained model for inference on new data or integrate it into existing applications.
